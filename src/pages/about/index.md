    Busoga Nordic Development Association (BUNDA) was formed about in August
    2014, arising from the desire to get together and get to know other Basoga
    living in Denmark.


    We organized a social get-together dinner and met for the first time about
    10 people. Here we talked of the need of getting to know one another not
    only on a social level but also to create a Basoga union, to enable personal
    development as well as home development.


    Our aim was to bring together all Basogas living in the Nordic countries and
    creating a network to all other Basogas the world over, while at the same
    time establishing development networks with Busoga loving people in the
    whole world.

    Aiming at self-development, and development of Busoga, the Busoga Nordic
    planned to set up development projects in the kingdom, with emphasis on
    developing the most stable and natural resource in the region – The Basoga
    people – who will then be in position to engage in sustainable development
    projects in the region.


    We call upon whoever is interested in Sustainable development to join hands
    with us as with start with Busoga and spread the projects in the rest of the
    country, Africa, and the world at large.
